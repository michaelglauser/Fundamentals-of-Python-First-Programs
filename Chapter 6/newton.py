#Package Newtonâ€™s method for approximating square roots (Case Study: Approximating Square Roots) in a function named newton.
#This function expects the input number as an argument and returns the estimate of its square root.
#The script should also include a main function that allows the user to compute square roots of inputs until she presses the enter/return key.
