# Write a program that takes the length of an edge (an integer) as input and prints the cube's surface area as output.


cube_edge_length = int(input("Enter the length of the cube's edge: "))
cube_area = (cube_edge_length * cube_edge_length) * 6
print ("The surface area of the cube is " + str(cube_area) + " square units")



#Output
#Enter the length of the cube's edge: 
#2
#The surface area of the cube is 24 square units
