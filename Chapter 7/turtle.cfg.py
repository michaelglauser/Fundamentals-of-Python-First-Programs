#Python Programs Chapter 7 Project 1
#Define a function drawCircle.
#This function should expect a Turtle object, the coordinates of the circle’s center point, and the circle’s radius as arguments.
#The function should draw the specified circle.
#The algorithm should draw the circle’s circumference by turning 3 degrees and moving a given distance 120 times.
#Calculate the distance moved with the formula 2.0 * p * radius / 120.0.
