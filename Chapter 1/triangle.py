Python Chapter 1, Project 5 
      
Modify the program of Project 4 to compute the area of a triangle. Issue the appropriate prompts for the triangle's base and height, and change tha names of the variables accordingly.
Then use the formula .5*base*height to compute the area. Test in an IDLE window


# Put your code here
base = float(input("Enter the triangle base: "))
height = float(input("Enter the triangle height: "))
area = 0.5 * base * height
print("The area of the triangle is", area, "square units.")


Enter the triangle base: 
4
Enter the triangle height: 
5
The area of the triangle is 10.0 square units.
